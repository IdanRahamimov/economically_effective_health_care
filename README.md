# Economically Effective Health Care
- unfinished 

## Introduction

Health care today is a critical discussion point. On one hand, modern medical knowledge and tools enable us to treat a wide range of illnesses, and even replace limbs and organs. However, these treatments are not free. The cost varies significantly, with some treatments costing a minimal amount while others can run into the millions. Furthermore, these costs can vary dramatically between countries.

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to make health care decision-making easier by identifying diseases where treatment would be more economically profitable for a country, compared to not providing treatment.

We will examine a variety of diseases and analyze the cost-effectiveness of treatments, considering factors such as:

- Costs associated with treatments
- The impact of the disease on a person's ability to work
- Long-term impacts on individuals who cannot access free treatments

By the end of this project, we hope to provide actionable insights that can inform health care policy and contribute to more equitable, effective health care systems.
